  "body": "# Welcome to Ack.\r\nI created this application because at work we lacked a good way of tracking and recognising the great things our people do every day. I believe that this application solves that problem.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* Submit nominations on the line, rather than in paper - no more lost nominations!\r\n* Relational model for people and nominations, A person can have many nominations, but a nomination must only be linked to one person.\r\n* Rich nomination data. We track data on the value that was displayed, the deeper reason for nomination, the time of nomination and obviously who the nomination relates to. All this stuff can now be grouped, sorted and tracked over time.\r\n* A full suite of monitoring and management tools - J-Hipster has done a great job around these tools.\r\n* Fully containerised and composed - Ready for immediate deployment via docker compose up or using Rancher for Orchestration and Scheduling\r\n\r\n### Underlying Systems\r\nThis application is built with Java and Angular 1.x - The excellent J-Hipster Generator. Big Kudos to those guys for the great work. I'm looking forward to the Angular 2 version!\r\nI've chosen to use PostgreSQL with ehcache and hibernate. OAuth 2 without social login and Gatling for tests.\r\n\r\nFor further details, check out the README",
